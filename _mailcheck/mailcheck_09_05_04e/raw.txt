Subject: [LCHEA-list] Family in need
MessageBody: Hello LCHEA Families!
We have a LCHEA family that is in desperate need of curriculum.
Please look through your stuff and email or call me if you can donate to this family.
The Grades are:
1st Grade
4th Grade
5th Grade
This family is part of our LCHEA family, that is why I put this on the main loop. 
Please take this need seriously, it does not matter to this family what kind of curriculum you give. As long as each subject is covered for each child and that the parents have answer books for the student's tests. 
They have no money to buy curriculum because they are about $20.00 shy of their house or rent payment.
So, "cheap" curriculum for them to buy can not be the answer.
***Please pray for them also and ask The Lord what He wants you to do in this situation.
And for another reminder....If you have any books you do not want anymore and want to get out of your house please give to the Giving Ministry, please call or email me!!   :)
Thank you everyone for your compassion!!
Missy

Subject: [Board-2000] web and member question
MessageBody: Re the web:

Just this am I went to web site and tried to access members only section using some of the member user ids from list that Joanne distributed at meeting.  I was able to enter members only with two of the three names that I tried.  Should not this way of entry be disabled?  I guess it could wait til Rick next does our updates, etc,.  Someone mentioned at Bd meeting that at least one of these names was no longer a member, in which case, perhaps Rick can disable now so that all members must use the "request log in account" button if they want access from here on out.  


Also, there may not be a way around this, but thought I would ask.  I think that it is not very professional for us to have a newsletter on line that is incomplete or half-done.  Once someone "publishes" her section, it is on line  waiting for other sections.  This just might be my compusiveness, but seems if a member went to print sometime between 25th and 1st, they would get part of current month and part of next month.  The main heading still has the current month, so maybe it is just a matter of explaining to membership that it is a hybrid/mixed newsletter during these times until the heading has the new month on it.  Thought I would ask.

Re a "member"... Elizabeth Harrell posted to the Classed loop on Sept 2.  I could not find her on any roster.  I don't think she renewed.  Sandy, if you could confirm this and then Joanne... do you take her off the classed loop?  I know that she is in the midst of a move and probably forgot to renew, so may just need a reminder which I could do, but in meantime, she needs to be taken off lchea loops.  Let me know if I need to email her that she needs to renew or if you Joanne will do.

MessageBody: Denise,
I noticed the same thing about the newsletter as you mentioned.  And
your right, it is confusing.  I started our Home High section with the
name of the month to help clear things up for members.  But, it seems
like this should be changed.  
 
If there are people on the list that we *know* have moved away, or are
not members (as mentioned at the meeting) why don't we at least delete
those user names/passwords?  We all have the list, we could send the
names to delete to ...who? Tracy or Sandy?

Subject: [LCHEA-list] Exemptions, preschool
MessageBody: Hello, all.
Does anyone out there know anyone who has gotten a religious exemption--or any other kind of exemption--from being vaccinated before entering public schools?  
Also, is there anyone out there interested in doing a "pre-school co-op" of sorts?  I know someone who doesn't want to use a traditional preschool, but would like to get together with some other parents and do a "I'll teach 'em today, you teach 'em next time" approach.  
Anyone with answers to these questions, and I will pass on the info.  
Thank you!

Subject: FW: [LCHEA-list] Exemptions, preschool
MessageBody: Stacy,

 I don't know of any exemptions but I do know that vaccination has been
villified by religious groups for generations.  They have been proven wrong
time and time again, many times through serious illness or death.  I've been
in other countries (through the Navy) where vaccinations were not used and
some even forbidden.  Measles, TB, and many other illnesses were rapant;
they are virtually irradicated in our country primarily through vaccination.

 It would be a good idea to seek the advice of a good Christian doctor.  One
such physician is Dr. Redwine on Dorchester Road.  He prays with his
patients and plays praise and worship music in his waiting room.  Although
he is not a pediatrician, I'm sure he can recommend a good one for you.  I
think you will find that avoiding vaccination is a serious mistake.  I would
not be willing to coop with any parent who does not immunize.

 Kenny

    Does anyone out there know anyone who has gotten a religious
exemption--or any other kind of exemption--from being vaccinated before
entering public schools?
    Also, is there anyone out there interested in doing a "pre-school co-op"
of sorts?  I know someone who doesn't want to use a traditional preschool,
but would like to get together with some other parents and do a "I'll teach
'em today, you teach 'em next time" approach.
    Anyone with answers to these questions, and I will pass on the info.
    Thank you!
    Stacy Howard

I 2nd what Kenny said about Dr. Redwine.  My entire family has been seeing
him for close to 15 years.  He delivered my 2nd child.  He is a family
practitioner.  He sees the entire family from babies to senior citizens.  He
also does mission trips a couple times a year to provide medical care to
nations that have very little.

I would trust the advice he gives.

Stacy,

 I don't know of any exemptions but I do know that vaccination has been
villified by religious groups for generations.  They have been proven wrong
time and time again, many times through serious illness or death.  I've been
in other countries (through the Navy) where vaccinations were not used and
some even forbidden.  Measles, TB, and many other illnesses were rapant;
they are virtually irradicated in our country primarily through vaccination.

 It would be a good idea to seek the advice of a good Christian doctor.  One
such physician is Dr. Redwine on Dorchester Road.  He prays with his
patients and plays praise and worship music in his waiting room.  Although
he is not a pediatrician, I'm sure he can recommend a good one for you.  I
think you will find that avoiding vaccination is a serious mistake.  I would
not be willing to coop with any parent who does not immunize.

 Kenny

MessageBody: Good morning,
    The publishing issue was solved last week. Your newsletter articles 
will no longer go live until Tracy publishes them.
    As to the members on our members only list: this needs to be done be 
LCHEA people, it does not make sense to use up the allotted time we have 
with Rick on things that we can easily do ourselves. All those with 
access to the IT section have the ability to remove members.

Subject: [LCHEA-SummervilleGroup] baby sitter needed
MessageBody: My husband will be out of town this week.  I need a baby sitter for Tuesday
during the meeting.  My 4 mth old usually goes to sleep around 8 pm and
sleeps all night.  If I take him to the meeting he will most likely only get
a cat nap in and wake up.  Then he will be difficult to put back to sleep.

I have asked all the baby sitters I know.  Does anyone know a reliable
teenager that is use to babysitting babies.

Let me know.

Thanks
Amy L. King

Subject: [LCHEA-list] Family in need
MessageBody: Hello LCHEA Families!
We have a LCHEA family that is in desperate need of curriculum.
Please look through your stuff and email or call me if you can donate to this family.
The Grades are:
1st Grade
4th Grade
5th Grade
This family is part of our LCHEA family, that is why I put this on the main loop. 
Please take this need seriously, it does not matter to this family what kind of curriculum you give. As long as each subject is covered for each child and that the parents have answer books for the student's tests. 
They have no money to buy curriculum because they are about $20.00 shy of their house or rent payment.
So, "cheap" curriculum for them to buy can not be the answer.
***Please pray for them also and ask The Lord what He wants you to do in this situation.
And for another reminder....If you have any books you do not want anymore and want to get out of your house please give to the Giving Ministry, please call or email me!!   :)
Thank you everyone for your compassion!!
Missy

Subject: [Board-2000] web and member question
MessageBody: Re the web:

Just this am I went to web site and tried to access members only section using some of the member user ids from list that Joanne distributed at meeting.  I was able to enter members only with two of the three names that I tried.  Should not this way of entry be disabled?  I guess it could wait til Rick next does our updates, etc,.  Someone mentioned at Bd meeting that at least one of these names was no longer a member, in which case, perhaps Rick can disable now so that all members must use the "request log in account" button if they want access from here on out.  


Also, there may not be a way around this, but thought I would ask.  I think that it is not very professional for us to have a newsletter on line that is incomplete or half-done.  Once someone "publishes" her section, it is on line  waiting for other sections.  This just might be my compusiveness, but seems if a member went to print sometime between 25th and 1st, they would get part of current month and part of next month.  The main heading still has the current month, so maybe it is just a matter of explaining to membership that it is a hybrid/mixed newsletter during these times until the heading has the new month on it.  Thought I would ask.

Re a "member"... Elizabeth Harrell posted to the Classed loop on Sept 2.  I could not find her on any roster.  I don't think she renewed.  Sandy, if you could confirm this and then Joanne... do you take her off the classed loop?  I know that she is in the midst of a move and probably forgot to renew, so may just need a reminder which I could do, but in meantime, she needs to be taken off lchea loops.  Let me know if I need to email her that she needs to renew or if you Joanne will do.

MessageBody: Denise,
I noticed the same thing about the newsletter as you mentioned.  And
your right, it is confusing.  I started our Home High section with the
name of the month to help clear things up for members.  But, it seems
like this should be changed.  
 
If there are people on the list that we *know* have moved away, or are
not members (as mentioned at the meeting) why don't we at least delete
those user names/passwords?  We all have the list, we could send the
names to delete to ...who? Tracy or Sandy?

Re the web:

Just this am I went to web site and tried to access members only
section using some of the member user ids from list that Joanne
distributed at meeting. I was able to enter members only with two of the
three names that I tried. Should not this way of entry be disabled? I
guess it could wait til Rick next does our updates, etc,. Someone
mentioned at Bd meeting that at least one of these names was no longer a
member, in which case, perhaps Rick can disable now so that all members
must use the "request log in account" button if they want access from
here on out. 


Also, there may not be a way around this, but thought I would ask. I
think that it is not very professional for us to have a newsletter on
line that is incomplete or half-done. Once someone "publishes" her
section, it is on line waiting for other sections. This just might be my
compusiveness, but seems if a member went to print sometime between 25th
and 1st, they would get part of current month and part of next month.
The main heading still has the current month, so maybe it is just a
matter of explaining to membership that it is a hybrid/mixed newsletter
during these times until the heading has the new month on it. Thought I
would ask.

Re a "member"... Elizabeth Harrell posted to the Classed loop on Sept
2. I could not find her on any roster. I don't think she renewed. Sandy,
if you could confirm this and then Joanne... do you take her off the
classed loop? I know that she is in the midst of a move and probably
forgot to renew, so may just need a reminder which I could do, but in
meantime, she needs to be taken off lchea loops. Let me know if I need
to email her that she needs to renew or if you Joanne will do.

Subject: [LCHEA-list] Exemptions, preschool
MessageBody: Hello, all.
Does anyone out there know anyone who has gotten a religious exemption--or any other kind of exemption--from being vaccinated before entering public schools?  
Also, is there anyone out there interested in doing a "pre-school co-op" of sorts?  I know someone who doesn't want to use a traditional preschool, but would like to get together with some other parents and do a "I'll teach 'em today, you teach 'em next time" approach.  
Anyone with answers to these questions, and I will pass on the info.  
Thank you!

Subject: FW: [LCHEA-list] Exemptions, preschool
MessageBody: Stacy,

 I don't know of any exemptions but I do know that vaccination has been
villified by religious groups for generations.  They have been proven wrong
time and time again, many times through serious illness or death.  I've been
in other countries (through the Navy) where vaccinations were not used and
some even forbidden.  Measles, TB, and many other illnesses were rapant;
they are virtually irradicated in our country primarily through vaccination.

 It would be a good idea to seek the advice of a good Christian doctor.  One
such physician is Dr. Redwine on Dorchester Road.  He prays with his
patients and plays praise and worship music in his waiting room.  Although
he is not a pediatrician, I'm sure he can recommend a good one for you.  I
think you will find that avoiding vaccination is a serious mistake.  I would
not be willing to coop with any parent who does not immunize.

I 2nd what Kenny said about Dr. Redwine.  My entire family has been seeing
him for close to 15 years.  He delivered my 2nd child.  He is a family
practitioner.  He sees the entire family from babies to senior citizens.  He
also does mission trips a couple times a year to provide medical care to
nations that have very little.

I would trust the advice he gives.

MessageBody: Good morning,
    The publishing issue was solved last week. Your newsletter articles 
will no longer go live until Tracy publishes them.
    As to the members on our members only list: this needs to be done be 
LCHEA people, it does not make sense to use up the allotted time we have 
with Rick on things that we can easily do ourselves. All those with 
access to the IT section have the ability to remove members.

Subject: RE: [LCHEA-list] Exemptions, preschool
MessageBody: Whoa.  Just for the record, I am not the one seeking the info on this. I had my three vaccinated and my pediatrician/daughter's godfather would probably try to knock some sense into me if I suggested otherwise.  Someone I spoke with yesterday is looking for some answers on this.  I don't agree with the decision, but it is her and her husband's to make and she doesn't seem willing to be talked out of it by me or anyone else at this point.  So, I was hoping to help her find the info on exemptions they needed if this was the route they were going to take.

Subject: [LCHEA-SummervilleGroup] baby sitter needed
MessageBody: My husband will be out of town this week.  I need a baby sitter for Tuesday
during the meeting.  My 4 mth old usually goes to sleep around 8 pm and
sleeps all night.  If I take him to the meeting he will most likely only get
a cat nap in and wake up.  Then he will be difficult to put back to sleep.

I have asked all the baby sitters I know.  Does anyone know a reliable
teenager that is use to babysitting babies.

Let me know.

Thanks
Amy L. King

Subject: [Board-2000] website versus Yahoo
MessageBody: Hello Everyone,

I've just responded to a new member's message sent to Joanne and cc'd to me.  Our two systems have confused her.  I expect this to be a regularly occurring problem with new members.  Below, you'll find a message slightly modified from the one I sent her.  Please feel free to use it if your new members have difficulty with the two systems.

Tracy

Hi,

LCHEA's use of two different internet systems can be very confusing.  I hope my words below can relieve your confusion.  If not, please contact me for additional information.

1.  The emails you receive are not generated by nor pass through our website - 
www.lchea.org.  They are created through a free system called Yahoo Groups.  To 
establish membership with Yahoo so that you can use all of its services, go 
to:
http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register?.done=http://groups.yahoo.com&.src=ygrp

Complete its membership form.  This will allow you to view archived mail, 
files, photos, calendar, and other information stored for each Yahoo group to 
which you belong.  You most likely belong to LCHEA-list (the email loop for all 
LCHEA) and the email loop for our satellite group.

2.  The website, www.lchea.org, is LCHEA's website.  Anyone can enter and view 
basic information.  However, if you'd like to view members only material, you 
need to request a login account.  In order to be fully aware of all that LCHEA 
offers and to access our monthly newsletter, you need to do this.  The steps 
are listed below:

a) Enter www.lchea.org
b) Click on the Members button (near upper right)
c) Click on Request Login Account (blue lettering in center of page)
d) Completely fill out the form.
e) Write down the user name and password you have chosen.
f) Click Submit Your Request.
g) Wait.  Your request will be processed and approved within a few hours to a 
few days.
h) After approval, please type your user name and password each time you enter 
the Members area.  You may change your password whenever you would like.

I hope this information resolves your problems with our internet usage.  
Welcome to LCHEA!

Subject: [Board-2000] website library lists
MessageBody: Good morning!

I know you have nothing else to do, so I thought I'd add another item to your plate. ;)  Susan and/or the group leaders have given me files for the HHS and SV libraries.  It would be great if all the libraries could be listed.  The longer we wait in getting the entire page put together, the more likely it will be that these two list will become outdated.  Therefore, before September 25th, please have your librarian put together a list of materials contained within your library.  This list should be produced using Word.  Because the libraries are not inter-related, they do not have to follow the same format.  The list could be basic or could include full descriptions for each book, the choice is yours.

Suggestions for list creation:
-one section for books and other written materials, one section for video materials
-materials grouped according to function: curriculum by grade, parent support/encouragement, unit studies, South Carolina materials, testing related materials, etc.
-author, publication year (or edition), page number, brief summary included

Thanks.

Tracy

MessageBody: 
Updates on Member Access and Monthly Newsletter...

Joanne, Debbie, and I have been emailing about the members who've not changed their passwords.  As soon as a definite plan is in place, it will be implemented.  I have the ability to remove members from the website.

Since the August newsletter went live more or less, it's been obvious that a timing problem exists.  In order to reduce confusion during the IT editor transition, I chose to communicate with Rick only as yearbook editor.  Therefore, I did not discuss this issue with him.  However, while I was away, he made changes to the process.  I don't completely understand them and perhaps would like them changed somewhat.  I plan to talk with Rick this week and will update you after all is clear.

Newsletter is my IT priority of the month.  Here are the subcategories that will be addressed.  I will update you as appropriate.

1.  Learn about and communicate to the board the new newsletter submission/go live procedures.  Have Rick change slightly if needed.
2.  Assure Grace has workable access.
3.  The table of contents is from July.  Create and have installed a general one that will work for each month: chair, community news, each satellite, HHS, Class Ed, and Yearbook.  Then it will not need adjustment each month.
4.  Have Rick remove the calendar. 
5.  Establish a newsletter archives section on the web.  It would begin with the June 2004 issue.  My goal is to store one year's worth of documents.  After that, because of space limitations, they would be deleted from the web but stored by the IT editor on disk.

MessageBody: I have honestly tried to post when families have switched satellite groups,
but I feel some may have slipped through the cracks (on my end).  Please
take a look through the new complete administrative roster I posted today
against your sheets (2nd page of application sheets).  You should be able to
tell which families have switched.  Please pull out those sheets and pass
them on to the new SGLs.  I apologize for putting this on you and will try
to make a huge effort to do better at letting you know when these things
happen.  Of course, as they do, you will need to pass those sheets on to the
current leaders.  Thanks!

Subject: How should We Then Live
MessageBody:  
Hi Grace,

I enjoyed your post from the Class Ed group.  I'm in the middle of reading
How Should We Then Live, and I remember you mentioning the video tapes.  Do
you have them or did someone else own them when you went through them?  

Kari

Cajun for "a little something extra."  

As you might notice, its a little late, but I've been wrestling with some
problems and having a hard time getting to sleep.  Just a thought re our
focus group, I'm still working my way through the Age of Faith by Durant
that I brought to the meeting.  I finally reached page 611!  I've already
had an opportunity to consult it about the life of St. Augustine.  I never
knew that the Donatists were another sect of the fundamental Baptists!  Just
kidding.

In the meantime, I took a little jaunt back through The Lord of the Rings,
of which I read The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring out loud to Sara &
Sam.  As I shared with the group, I had to edit as I was reading aloud just
to keep the pace of the story from bogging down into too many details.
Tolkien's imagery and attention to detail is so vivid and yet cozy so I
hated to do this. I also decided to delve into some related material.  

This rabbit trail took me through a recent book written about the mythology
of Tolkien's works, _One Ring to Rule Them All_ by Anne Petty (the first
chapter went immediately above my head when she used advanced math to
describe the plot) but the rest is very interesting which helped me to
dissect and analyze the story further. She does a good job treating the
symbology of the characters and their actions. 
I thought this was excellent as I hadn't really delved that deep into
Tolkien's works before. 

I also enjoyed a biography about Tolkien himself.  I didn't know as much
about him as I knew about C.S. Lewis.  A quote struck me as pertinent to
where we are which I thought you might enjoy too but I'll paraphrase it
here, 'its the hands of the little people which turn the wheels (of) in life
(get the job done) when the eyes of the bigger people are turned elsewhere
(more self-seeking ambition).'

Samwise is my penultimate hero as he selflessly followed his friend and even
carried him on his back to the very "cracks of Doom" to help him achieve his
goal. Would that I could be that kind of friend.  A lovely expression of I
Corinthians 13:5 "(Love)Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its
own..."  The virtues that Tolkien's characters expressed seemed out of place
for the time in which the book was published as many of his contemporaries'
works were more reflective of the philosophers' vanity in taking the final
step below the line of despair (as Francis Schaffer put it) and their works
reflected the ugliness of the world with even more ugliness still (James
Joyce, J. D. Salinger, John Steinbeck to name a couple).

Of course, one rabbit trail lead into another deeper hole and took me back
to reading The Book of Lost Tales, Vol. I, which has Christopher Tolkien's
commentaries following each tale.  Which brought me to the point of wanting
to read the Silmarillion all the way through again, but Dorchester County
Library doesn't have a copy thus my wish to be gratified must be
indefinitely delayed.  Alack and alas...

In another more practical vein, I'm still trying to work out a schedule
incorporating Denise's ideas on how to handle those "extras" 
that need doing.  We've had a good start with our classes, pushing on into
Latina Christiana II.  This year we will be using the Reading Comprehension
Guide suggested by Veritas to go through _The Mixed Up Files of Basil E.
Frankweiler_.  But enough about what we are doing...How and what are the
rest of you up to?  

Keeping the Faith,

Grace
