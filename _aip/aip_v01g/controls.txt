This program uses Microsoft's Flexible Grid, TAB and Statusbar controls.

These controls require the following OCX files to be installed to the computer.

MSFLXGRD.OCX	- Flexible Grid Control
MSCOMCTL.OCX	- TAB and Statusbar Controls

If you get errors pertaining to some 'class ID' that cannot be found, etc....this is
most likely the problem.

Do you have this file?  Go to Start...Search (or Find) and look for 

MSFLXGRD.OCX
MSCOMCTL.OCX

on your hard drive. It is usually located in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM folder (Win98,98,ME).

If it is not found then download the files from

HTTP://WWW.CLG-NET.COM/AI/INDEX.HTM

Once the files are downloaded, the control must be registered.  Go to Start..Run and type:

REGSVR32 C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSFLXGRD.OCX and click OK.
REGSVR32 C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSCOMCTL.OCX and click OK.

A message box will be displayed that says something like:

DLLRegisterServer in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSFLXGRD.OCX succeeded.
DLLRegisterServer in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSCOMCTL.OCX succeeded.

Now, run the AIP program and all should work.
